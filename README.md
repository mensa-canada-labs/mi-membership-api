# Mensa International Membership API - Proposal

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**This repository contains a technical specification proposal and is not an official Mensa International project.**

This is a detailed specification document for a potential API system that could enable national Mensa organizations to automate their membership operations and synchronize member data with Mensa International systems. The API is designed to serve as a connection point to Mensa International's internal systems.

**Repository Context**: This repository is hosted under Mensa Canada's GitHub organization as it represents the work of one of its members, but the proposed API solution is intended to benefit the entire global Mensa network.

## Overview

This repository serves as a storage and documentation space for a proposed API solution that would act as a **connection point to Mensa International's internal systems**, allowing national Mensa organizations to:

- **Automate member lifecycle management** (registrations, renewals, departures)
- **Synchronize member data** with Mensa International systems
- **Coordinate member transfers** between national organizations
- **Streamline administrative processes** through batch operations
- **Maintain data consistency** across the global Mensa network

## Repository Purpose

The primary goals of this technical specification proposal are to:

1. **Document a comprehensive API design** that addresses the operational needs of national Mensa organizations
2. **Demonstrate technical feasibility** of automated membership management
3. **Provide a foundation for discussion** with Mensa International stakeholders
4. **Serve as a reference** for potential future development efforts

## What's Included

- **[API.md](API.md)** - Complete API reference documentation including:
  - Detailed endpoint specifications
  - Request/response formats
  - Authentication and security model
  - Error handling and validation rules
  - Batch processing capabilities
  - Real-world usage examples

## Key Features of the Proposed API

### üîÑ Batch Processing
- Process up to 500 member operations per request
- Independent processing of each member within a batch
- Efficient handling of large-scale operations (annual renewals, imports)

### üåç Global Coordination
- Automated member transfer coordination between national Mensas
- Centralized member data management
- Prevention of duplicate memberships across organizations

### üîí Security & Compliance
- Unique API keys for each national organization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Comprehensive data validation
- Full audit trail with request tracking

### üìä Flexible Operations
- Support for annual and lifetime memberships
- Member verification for traveling members
- Administrative actions (exclusions, updates)
- Conversion between membership types

## Technical Approach

The proposed API follows REST principles with:
- **JSON-based** request/response format
- **HTTP status codes** for operation results
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed error messages
- **Rate limiting** to ensure system stability
- **Batch processing** for operational efficiency

## Proposal Status

This is a **technical specification proposal**. The API design presented here:

- ‚úÖ Has been carefully designed based on typical membership management needs
- ‚úÖ Includes comprehensive documentation and examples
- ‚úÖ Addresses security, scalability, and operational requirements
- ‚ùå Has not been implemented or tested
- ‚ùå Has not been approved by Mensa International
- ‚ùå Is not currently available for use

## Disclaimer

This repository and its contents represent an independent technical specification proposal developed by a member of Mensa Canada. While hosted under Mensa Canada's GitHub organization, this project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to Mensa International or any national Mensa organization's official operations. All API designs, documentation, and technical specifications are conceptual and provided for evaluation purposes only.

The proposed API is designed to interface with Mensa International's internal systems, but no official collaboration or approval from Mensa International has been established for this proposal.
